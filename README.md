# Comprehensive Interview Analysis System

This project focuses on analyzing interview candidates by performing facial emotion recognition, audio transcription, sentiment analysis, and MBTI assessment. The system generates a comprehensive report based on these analyses.

## Project Description

The Comprehensive Interview Analysis System leverages advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques to evaluate interview candidates. The system processes video input, extracts audio, transcribes speech to text, analyzes facial emotions, performs sentiment analysis on the transcribed text, and determines the MBTI personality type of the candidate. Finally, it generates a detailed report of the analysis.

## Features

- **Facial Emotion Recognition**: Analyzes facial expressions to determine the candidate's emotions during the interview.
- **Audio Transcription**: Converts the audio from the interview video into text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the transcribed text to evaluate the candidate's responses.
- **MBTI Assessment**: Determines the candidate's MBTI personality type based on their responses.
- **Report Generation**: Compiles the results of all analyses into a comprehensive report.
